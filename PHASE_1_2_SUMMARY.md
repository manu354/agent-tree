# Phase 1 & 2 Implementation Summary

## Phase 1: Technical Debt Removal ✅

### Completed:
1. **Deleted MCP client** - Removed `src/mcp_client.py` entirely
2. **Removed Gemini decomposition** - Deleted `_call_gemini_for_decomposition()` method
3. **Removed all fallback logic** - No more "if X fails, try Y" patterns
4. **Cleaned up imports** - Removed all MCP-related imports and checks
5. **Simplified methods** - Removed JSON-based decomposition logic

### Code Reduction:
- Removed ~200 lines of unnecessary code
- No more fallback paths or alternative implementations
- Single execution path through Claude CLI only

## Phase 2: Markdown-First Decomposition ✅

### Implemented:
1. **New file structure** - Exactly as specified:
   ```
   workspace/
   └── <problem_name>/
       └── <problem_name>.md
       └── subproblems/
           ├── <subproblem_1>.md
           ├── <subproblem_2>.md
           └── ...
   ```

2. **Markdown format** - Implemented with word limits:
   ```markdown
   # [Subproblem Name]
   
   ## Type
   simple | complex
   
   ## Problem
   [Description - MAX 100 WORDS]
   
   ## Possible Solution
   [Approach - MAX 100 WORDS]
   
   ## Notes
   [Context - MAX 100 WORDS]
   ```

3. **Key methods added**:
   - `decompose_to_markdown()` - Claude creates markdown files directly
   - `is_problem_complex()` - Simple detection logic (first occurrence wins)
   - `_generate_problem_name()` - Safe filesystem names from problems
   - `execute_bottom_up()` - Post-order traversal execution

4. **Removed JSON parsing** - Claude now uses Write tool to create files directly

5. **Added comprehensive unit tests** - All 6 tests pass

### Test Results:
Successfully tested with "Calculate the factorial of 5":
- Claude created the expected file structure
- Generated 3 subproblems (all marked as simple)
- Files follow the exact markdown format specified

## Complexity Reduction Achieved:

1. **Removed all fallback logic** - Single path execution
2. **Simplified prompts** - Removed planning.md creation from solve_simple and integrate_solutions
3. **Direct file creation** - No JSON intermediary
4. **Cleaner abstractions** - Clear separation between decomposition and execution phases

## What's Next:

Phase 3 (Pause and Edit Flow) is partially implemented - the system already pauses after decomposition. The full recursive decomposition before pause needs to be completed as specified in the plan.

## Files Modified:
- `src/agent_node.py` - Reduced from ~370 to 233 lines
- `src/agent_tree.py` - Updated to use markdown-based decomposition
- `tests/test_markdown_decomposition.py` - New comprehensive test suite

The system now follows the vision from human_vision_3.txt exactly: markdown files as primary interface, pause for user editing, and bottom-up execution.
