# Analyze Current Tree Representation

## Type
complex

## Problem
Examine how agent-tree currently represents task relationships and execution patterns. Understand the limitations of representing O->a,b,c when the actual dependency is a->b->c. Identify gaps between intended sequential execution and current parallel representation.

## Possible Solution
Review agent_tree.py and agent_node.py code to understand current implementation. Document how tasks are decomposed and executed. Identify specific code patterns that assume parallel execution when sequential might be needed.

## Notes
This analysis forms the foundation for understanding what needs to change. Focus on the mismatch between logical dependencies and tree structure representation in the current system.
