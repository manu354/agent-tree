# Evaluate Performance Implications

## Type
simple

## Problem
Analyze the performance trade-offs of parallel vs sequential execution in agent-tree. Consider factors like total execution time, resource utilization, context window efficiency, and quality of results. Determine when parallelization provides real benefits.

## Possible Solution
Create benchmarks comparing sequential and parallel execution on various problem types. Measure metrics like time-to-solution, token usage, and solution quality. Identify problem characteristics that benefit most from parallelization.

## Notes
Performance isn't just about speed - consider cognitive load, debugging complexity, and result consistency. Some problems may actually perform worse with parallelization due to coordination overhead.
