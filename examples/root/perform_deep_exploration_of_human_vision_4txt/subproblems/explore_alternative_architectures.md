# Explore Alternative Architectures

## Type
complex

## Problem
Investigate whether a tree structure is the best representation for problems with complex dependencies. Consider alternative architectures like directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), workflow engines, or hybrid approaches that better capture execution patterns.

## Possible Solution
Research existing workflow orchestration systems and their dependency models. Evaluate graph-based representations that naturally support both parallel and sequential patterns. Consider how alternatives integrate with the current agent-tree philosophy.

## Notes
This is a fundamental architectural question. The solution might involve evolving beyond trees while maintaining the simplicity and clarity that makes agent-tree effective for problem decomposition.
