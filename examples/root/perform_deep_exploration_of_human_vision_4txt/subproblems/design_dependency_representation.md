# Design Dependency Representation

## Type
complex

## Problem
Design a new way to represent task dependencies that distinguishes between parallel (O->a,b,c) and sequential (a->b->c) execution patterns. Consider how to encode dependency information in the tree structure without breaking existing functionality.

## Possible Solution
Explore options like dependency graphs, execution order metadata, or modified tree structures. Consider adding dependency annotations to nodes or creating a separate dependency layer that complements the tree structure.

## Notes
Must balance expressiveness with simplicity. The solution should be intuitive for users while providing enough information for the execution engine to optimize task scheduling.
