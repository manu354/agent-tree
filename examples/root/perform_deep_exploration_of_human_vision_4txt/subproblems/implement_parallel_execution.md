# Implement Parallel Execution

## Type
simple

## Problem
Create a proof-of-concept implementation that enables true parallel execution of independent tasks using Claude CLI. Address technical challenges like process management, result synchronization, and error handling in concurrent environments.

## Possible Solution
Use Python's asyncio or multiprocessing to spawn multiple Claude CLI instances. Implement a task queue system that respects dependencies. Create synchronization mechanisms for collecting and integrating results from parallel executions.

## Notes
Focus on practical implementation challenges. Consider resource limits, rate limiting, and how to handle failures in parallel branches. Must maintain deterministic results despite concurrent execution.
