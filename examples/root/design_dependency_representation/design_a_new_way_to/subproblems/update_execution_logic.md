# Update Execution Logic

## Type
complex

## Problem
Modify agent_tree.py execution logic to respect dependency specifications. Change from processing all children to processing based on dependency graph. Handle parallel groups and sequential chains efficiently.

## Possible Solution
Build dependency graph from markdown files. Use topological sort for execution order. Execute parallel groups concurrently (future enhancement). Add dependency resolution before solve_recursive calls.

## Notes
Major change to execution flow. Must handle cycles, missing dependencies. Consider progress tracking and error handling. Think about how Context propagates with dependencies.
