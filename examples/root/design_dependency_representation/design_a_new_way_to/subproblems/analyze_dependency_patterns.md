# Analyze Dependency Patterns

## Type
simple

## Problem
Study common task dependency patterns in problem decomposition (parallel, sequential, mixed) and identify use cases where each is appropriate. Consider real-world examples from the codebase and human_vision_4.txt.

## Possible Solution
Create a taxonomy of dependency patterns: pure parallel (independent tasks), pure sequential (strict ordering), fan-out/fan-in (parallel then converge), and mixed graphs. Document examples of each pattern.

## Notes
This analysis will inform the metadata design. Look at existing agent tree executions to understand implicit dependencies. Consider how humans naturally express dependencies in problem descriptions.
