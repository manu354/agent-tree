# Modify agent_tree.py Execution Logic

This task involves updating the agent_tree.py execution logic to process nodes based on dependency specifications rather than processing all children simultaneously. The system needs to handle parallel groups and sequential chains efficiently.

## Decomposition

1. **Parse Dependency Metadata** - Extract and interpret dependency information from task nodes
2. **Build Execution Graph** - Create a directed acyclic graph representing task dependencies
3. **Implement Parallel Group Handler** - Process nodes that can run in parallel together
4. **Implement Sequential Chain Handler** - Process nodes that must run sequentially
5. **Update Node Processing Logic** - Modify existing execution flow to use dependency-aware processing
