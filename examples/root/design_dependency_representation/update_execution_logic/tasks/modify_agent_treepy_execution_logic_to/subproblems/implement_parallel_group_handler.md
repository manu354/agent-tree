# Implement Parallel Group Handler

## Type
simple

## Problem
Create a handler that processes multiple nodes in parallel when they have no dependencies on each other. Must integrate with existing subprocess management for Claude CLI calls and handle concurrent execution efficiently.

## Possible Solution
Use Python's asyncio or concurrent.futures to run multiple nodes simultaneously. Collect results from all parallel executions. Handle failures gracefully without blocking other parallel tasks. Maintain existing timeout and error handling.

## Notes
Leverage existing subprocess infrastructure in agent_node.py. Ensure proper resource management to avoid overwhelming the system with too many concurrent processes. Consider adding configurable parallelism limits.
