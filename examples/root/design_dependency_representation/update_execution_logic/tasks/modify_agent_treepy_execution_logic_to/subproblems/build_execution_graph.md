# Build Execution Graph

## Type
complex

## Problem
Convert parsed dependency metadata into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents the execution order. The graph must identify parallel groups, sequential chains, and validate that no circular dependencies exist.

## Possible Solution
Use a graph library or implement custom graph structure. Build nodes and edges from dependency data. Perform topological sort to determine execution order. Group nodes by dependency level for parallel execution.

## Notes
This is complex because it requires graph algorithms like cycle detection and topological sorting. Must handle invalid dependency specifications gracefully and provide clear error messages for circular dependencies.
