# Update Node Processing Logic

## Type
simple

## Problem
Modify the existing solve_problem function in agent_tree.py to use dependency-aware processing instead of processing all children nodes. Integrate the new handlers while maintaining backward compatibility for nodes without dependency specifications.

## Possible Solution
Replace current child processing loop with dependency graph execution. Check for dependency metadata and fall back to existing behavior if none found. Call appropriate handlers based on dependency patterns. Update result integration logic.

## Notes
This is the integration point that ties everything together. Must ensure smooth transition between old and new behavior. Test thoroughly to avoid breaking existing functionality. Consider adding feature flag for gradual rollout.
