# Design a Metadata Format for Task Dependencies

## Problem Statement
We need to design a metadata format for expressing task dependencies in markdown files that supports parallel groups, sequential chains, and dependencies between tasks while being both human-readable and machine-parseable.

## Decomposition Strategy
This problem requires designing a flexible and robust metadata format that can express complex dependency relationships. We'll break it down into:

1. **Define Core Dependency Types** - Establish the fundamental dependency patterns (parallel, sequential, blocking)
2. **Design YAML/JSON Metadata Structure** - Create structured format for dependency declarations
3. **Develop Inline Annotation Syntax** - Design human-friendly inline syntax for simple dependencies
4. **Create Validation Schema** - Define rules and constraints for valid dependency graphs

## Key Considerations
- Balance between human readability and machine parseability
- Support for complex dependency graphs without becoming unwieldy
- Backward compatibility with existing markdown structures
- Clear distinction between different execution patterns
