# Identify Representation Limitations

## Type
simple

## Problem
Document specific limitations of tree-based task representation versus dependency graph representation. Include concrete examples where current representation fails to capture essential task relationships like a->b->c sequential execution.

## Possible Solution
Create examples showing how O->a,b,c representation loses information compared to a->b->c. Analyze why tree structure inherently cannot represent DAG-like dependencies between siblings.

## Notes
Consider both theoretical limitations (tree vs DAG) and practical impacts on agent-tree's execution model. Reference human_vision_4.txt for the motivating example.
