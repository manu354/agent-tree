# Analyze Context Propagation

## Type
simple

## Problem
Examine how the Context class propagates information between parent and child nodes. Identify what dependency information is missing and how sibling relationships are currently represented without execution order.

## Possible Solution
Review Context class structure, to_prompt() method, and how context is created in solve_recursive(). Document what information flows down the tree and what's missing for representing dependencies.

## Notes
Focus on context.py and how Context is instantiated in agent_tree.py. Note that sibling_tasks list has no ordering semantics.
