# Analysis of Agent-Tree Task Representation

## Current Representation

Agent-tree currently represents all subtasks as siblings under a parent node, creating a pure tree structure where:
- Parent O decomposes into children [a, b, c]
- All children are treated as parallelizable
- No explicit dependencies between siblings are captured

## Key Findings

1. **Parallel-by-Default Architecture**: The system executes bottom-up, processing all leaf nodes first, then integrating solutions at each level. This assumes all siblings can be solved independently.

2. **Context Propagation**: The Context class passes down root problem, parent task, and sibling tasks, but does not encode execution order or dependencies between siblings.

3. **Two-Phase Execution**: Decomposition phase creates the entire tree structure first, then execution phase processes bottom-up, inherently treating all siblings as parallel.

## Identified Gaps

1. **Sequential Dependencies Lost**: When a task requires a->b->c sequential execution, the current representation flattens this to O->[a,b,c], losing critical ordering information.

2. **No Dependency Graph**: The tree structure cannot represent that task 'b' depends on output from task 'a', or that 'c' requires both 'a' and 'b' to complete first.

3. **Inefficient for Sequential Tasks**: Sequential tasks get unnecessarily parallelized, potentially causing errors when later tasks depend on earlier results.

## Implications

- Current architecture works well for truly independent subtasks
- Fails when subtasks have interdependencies
- Cannot leverage parallel execution where it would be beneficial while respecting sequential constraints where necessary
