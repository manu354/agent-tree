# Perform Deep Exploration of human_vision_4.txt

## Overview
This task explores the concept of parallel execution in agent-tree and how to represent task dependencies effectively. The core question is whether the current tree representation adequately captures sequential vs parallel execution patterns.

## Key Questions
1. How should we represent task dependencies in the tree structure?
2. What are the implications of parallel vs sequential execution?
3. How can we optimize the agent-tree for different execution patterns?

## Decomposition Strategy
The exploration is divided into subproblems examining implementation, representation, performance, and architectural aspects of parallel execution in agent-tree.
