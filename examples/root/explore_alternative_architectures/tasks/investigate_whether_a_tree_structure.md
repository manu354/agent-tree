# Investigating Tree Structure vs Alternative Architectures

## Problem Overview
Current agent-tree uses a strict tree hierarchy for problem decomposition, but complex real-world problems often have:
- Shared dependencies between subtasks
- Non-hierarchical relationships
- Parallel execution opportunities
- Cyclic or iterative workflows

## Key Questions
1. Is tree structure limiting our ability to model complex problem dependencies?
2. What alternative architectures better capture execution patterns?
3. How do we balance simplicity with expressiveness?
4. What are the implementation trade-offs?

## Subproblems
1. **Compare Tree vs DAG Representations** - Analyze when DAGs provide clearer dependency modeling
2. **Analyze Workflow Engine Patterns** - Study established patterns from workflow orchestration systems
3. **Evaluate Hybrid Approaches** - Explore combinations that leverage benefits of multiple architectures
4. **Assess Implementation Complexity** - Evaluate practical trade-offs for agent-tree codebase
