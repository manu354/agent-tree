# Analyze Workflow Engine Patterns

## Type
simple

## Problem
Study established workflow orchestration systems (Apache Airflow, Prefect, Temporal, Argo) to understand proven patterns for handling complex dependencies. Extract relevant design principles that could apply to agent-based problem decomposition, focusing on execution strategies, dependency resolution, and state management approaches.

## Possible Solution
Research and document key patterns: task dependencies as first-class concepts, declarative vs imperative workflows, dynamic task generation, retry/failure handling, parallel execution strategies, and state persistence. Create mapping between workflow engine concepts and agent-tree requirements to identify transferable patterns.

## Notes
Workflow engines solve similar orchestration problems at different scales. Their mature patterns for handling DAGs, scheduling, and state management could inform agent-tree evolution. Focus on lightweight patterns suitable for LLM-based execution rather than heavy enterprise features.
