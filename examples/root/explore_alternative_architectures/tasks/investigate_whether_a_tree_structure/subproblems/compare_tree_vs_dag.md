# Compare Tree vs DAG Representations

## Type
complex

## Problem
Analyze the fundamental differences between tree and DAG representations for problem decomposition. Trees enforce strict parent-child hierarchies with no shared dependencies, while DAGs allow nodes to have multiple parents, enabling shared subtasks and more flexible dependency modeling. Need to understand when each is most appropriate.

## Possible Solution
Create comparative analysis examining: dependency expression capabilities, execution order constraints, shared resource handling, complexity of implementation, and real-world problem mapping. Use concrete examples from agent-tree scenarios to illustrate where tree limitations manifest and where DAGs would provide clearer models.

## Notes
Trees are simpler to reason about and implement but force artificial decomposition when subtasks share dependencies. DAGs better model real workflows but introduce complexity in execution ordering, cycle detection, and state management. Consider how current agent-tree context system would adapt.
