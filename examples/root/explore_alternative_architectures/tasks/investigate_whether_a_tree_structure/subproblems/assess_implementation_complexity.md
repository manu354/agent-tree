# Assess Implementation Complexity

## Type
simple

## Problem
Evaluate practical trade-offs of implementing alternative architectures in the agent-tree codebase. Consider code complexity, LLM token usage, debugging difficulty, state management overhead, and backward compatibility. Need realistic assessment of effort vs benefit for different architectural choices.

## Possible Solution
Analyze implementation requirements for each architecture: data structure changes, execution engine modifications, context system updates, solution integration logic. Create complexity matrix comparing current tree implementation against DAG, workflow engine, and hybrid alternatives across multiple dimensions.

## Notes
Must consider that LLM agents have context limits and benefit from simpler mental models. Complex architectures might overwhelm agents or require extensive prompting. Balance theoretical benefits against practical constraints of LLM-based execution and existing codebase structure.
