# Evaluate Hybrid Approaches

## Type
complex

## Problem
Explore architectural patterns that combine benefits of trees, DAGs, and workflow engines. Consider approaches like: tree backbone with DAG overlays for dependencies, hierarchical DAGs, pluggable execution strategies, or multi-phase architectures. Need to balance structural simplicity with flexibility for complex problems.

## Possible Solution
Design hybrid models that maintain tree's conceptual clarity while allowing dependency sharing. Examples: tree for primary decomposition with auxiliary dependency graph, phased execution (decompose as tree, execute as DAG), or adaptive structures that start simple and evolve complexity as needed.

## Notes
Hybrid approaches could provide migration path from current tree implementation. Key is finding right abstraction level that doesn't overwhelm LLM agents while enabling sophisticated dependency handling. Consider how context propagation and solution integration would work in hybrid models.
