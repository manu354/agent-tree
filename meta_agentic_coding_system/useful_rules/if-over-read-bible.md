When to use: Whenever you think have written a significant amount of code, you should review these rules.

Make sure your recent changes adhere to the following rules to avoid tech-debt:

1. I WILL MAKE SURE MY AGENT AFTER WRITING ANY CODE, RUNS THE PIPELINE, AND THE STATE SAYS IN A SYSTEM OF GREEN. 

2. MY SYSTEM WILL ALWAYS HAVE A SINGLE ATOMIC COMMAND TO PROVE CORRECTNESS OF SYSTEM. (so that LLM has minimal complexity for agent feedback loop) I SHOULD STRIVE TO ACHIEVE HIGH ACCURACY OF THIS CORRECTNESS, SO THAT I CAN BE RELIANT ON MY TESTS THAT SYSTEM IS PASSING.

3. I WILL STILL FOLLOW CONTINOUS IMPROVMENT OF THE SYSTEM, TESTABLE AND EVOLVEABLE. ANY CHANGE WILL HAVE TEST COVERAGE. I WILL NOT MAKE HUGE CHANGES AT ONCE, RATHER BREAK INTO SMALL TESTABLE UNITS OF WORK.

4. I WILL ONLY EVOLVE MY SYSTEM, NOT CREATE SINGNIFICANTLY CHANGED COPIES. 

4. MORE IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER, ANY CHANGE SHOULD BE BALANCED WITH THE TECH DEBT OF ADDING MORE COMPLEXITY.

5. ISOLATE YOUR DAMN CONCERNS AND KEEP YOUR CONCERNS SEPERATED. AFTER ANY CHANGE MAKE SURE YOU CLEAN UP YOUR ABSTRACTION, SEPARATE CODE INTO FOLDERS, AND HIDE DETAIL BEHIND A CLEAN API SO THAT OUTWARDS COMPLEXITY SHOWN IS MINIMIZED. THEN, AFTER DOING THIS ALSO REVIEW THE GENERAL ARCHITCUTE OF THE COLLECTION OF THESE APIS, DOES THE ARCHITCTURE LEVEL MAKE SENSE, ARE THE APIS THE RIGHT BALANCE OF GENERalITY (TO BE USEFUL) BUT SPECIFICITY & MINIMALNESS TO BE CLEAN & MINIMIZE OUTWARDSLY SHOWN COMPLEXITY.

6. I WILL NOT OVERLOAD ONE CHAT HISTORY WITH MORE THAN ONE PROBLEM CONTEXT, AS SOON AS THIS HAPPENS I WILL WARN THE USER TO COMPRESS MY TRAJECTORY AND START  FRESH.

7. please donâ€™t create temporary files, even if they are .md explanations of your work. 

(n+1th rule) end every prompt with: Once you have ensured all rules have passed, check if there are any other rule files that are relevant to run beyond this set of rules.
