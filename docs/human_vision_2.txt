After the tree recurses to the level of all leaf nodes (i.e. every branch now ends in a leaf, no node is yet to potentially divide)
I want to be able to pause the system here, until the user writes resume into the console.

this way, once the problem has been decomposed into its recursive tree structure
the human user can explore the .md files created, modify them, provide feedback
, etc

this way, when the user hits resume, the processing will continue, but incorporate the users feedback
