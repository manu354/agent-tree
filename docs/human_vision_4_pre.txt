So currently we have three phase

- decomposition, feedback, execution. 

Let's try it on a complex voice tree problem.




Now, one absolutely crucial concept with this whole simplication plan is the   
   desire to minimize complexity. The reason why we are doing this is because     
   the current system was getting too complex and hard to reason about. We want   
   this new system to be really clear, broken up into very clear modules which    
   are connected logically, without leaky abstractions. First let's draw a        
   mermaid diagram of the new system architecture and add it to our simplication  
   plan, as well as a flow diagram, then see if there are any areas that are      
   especially complex that we can work together on to reduce its complexity.
