# SWE-Benchmark Test Suite Summary

## Overview

I've successfully added a SWE-bench inspired benchmark test suite to test the Agent Tree system on complex, real-world software engineering challenges.

## What Was Created

### 1. `test_swe_benchmark.py`
A comprehensive test module with:
- **Synthetic Web App Test**: Multi-file bug fix scenario with Controller/Service/Data layers
- **Complex Refactoring Test**: SOLID principles refactoring of a monolithic calculator class
- Mock infrastructure to simulate deterministic LLM responses
- File system tools for creating test codebases

### 2. `BENCHMARK_README.md`
Documentation explaining:
- Test structure and purpose
- How to run the benchmarks
- How to extend with new test cases
- Why these tests matter for validating the agent tree system

### 3. `SWE_BENCHMARK_SUMMARY.md` (this file)
Summary of the implementation

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Synthetic Tests?

After analyzing SWE-bench problems like `django__django-15789`, we decided on synthetic tests because:

1. **Control**: We can design problems that perfectly test agent tree capabilities
2. **Determinism**: Tests run reliably without external dependencies
3. **Focus**: Tests specifically target hierarchical decomposition and multi-file coordination
4. **Speed**: Tests run quickly without full framework setup

### Test Characteristics

Both tests demonstrate problems that require:
- **Multi-file modifications** (3+ files)
- **Hierarchical decomposition** (main task → subtasks → sub-subtasks)
- **Complex reasoning** about code interdependencies
- **Coordination** between different parts of the system

## Results

✅ All tests pass successfully:
- `test_synthetic_web_app_bug_fix`: Tests multi-layer bug fix
- `test_complex_refactoring_task`: Tests architectural refactoring

## Future Improvements

1. Add more SWE-bench inspired scenarios (e.g., sympy mathematical bugs, requests HTTP handling)
2. Test parallel subtask execution
3. Add performance benchmarks
4. Include tests with actual file I/O operations
5. Add integration with real LLMs for end-to-end testing

## Usage

```bash
# Run all benchmark tests
python -m pytest test_swe_benchmark.py -v

# Run specific test
python -m pytest test_swe_benchmark.py::TestSWEBenchmark::test_synthetic_web_app_bug_fix -v
```

The benchmarks provide a solid foundation for testing the Agent Tree system against complex, real-world inspired software engineering challenges.
