# Vision 3 Comparison Findings

## Current System Already Implements Most of Vision

The system already has a two-phase approach matching the vision:

### Phase 1: Decomposition
- Creates markdown files with structure: `{problem_name}.md` and `{problem_name}/subproblems/<subproblem>x.md`
- Each markdown has: Type (simple/complex), Problem (100 words), Possible Solution (100 words), Notes (100 words)
- Only COMPLEX problems are recursed on
- Pauses after decomposition for user review/modification

### Phase 2: Execution  
- Bottom-up execution after user confirmation
- Post-order traversal (children first, then parents)
- Integration of child solutions by parent nodes

## Minor Gaps
1. Vision mentions `/tasks` folder - current system uses workspace root
2. Vision emphasizes being "critical of suggested solution" - not explicitly in current prompts

## Logical Bug Found
In `src/agent_tree.py` line ~134-138, when creating child context during decomposition:
```python
child_context = Context(
    root_problem=context.root_problem if context else problem,
    parent_task=task,
    parent_approach="",
    sibling_tasks=[]  # BUG: Always empty!
)
```

Siblings are not being collected and passed to children, violating the vision requirement that nodes should know about their sibling tasks.
