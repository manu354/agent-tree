Allow for parallel claude execution

Some tasks are parallel, some are sequential

Should we represent this with our tree?

i.e. O -> a -> b -> c  

currently thats o > a,b,c

should we instead represent it as a > b > c
to highlight the dependence order?

Or is there a better way of representing what can be parallelized?
