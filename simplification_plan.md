# Agent Tree Simplification Plan

## Overview
Transform the current monolithic agent-tree system into a cleaner two-phase architecture with separate `decompose` and `solve` commands.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Node Limit**: Keep 5-node limit during decomposition (max 5 Claude calls)
2. **Dependencies**: Use markdown `### Dependents` section with file links
3. **Input**: User provides initial task as .md file (not string)
4. **Folder Structure** (No file moving!): 
   - Task files: `{task_name}.md` - describe the problem/goal
   - Plan files: `{task_name}_plan.md` - decomposition analysis, progress tracking, and final summary
   - Children folder: `{task_name}_children/` - contains subtask files
   - NO separate solution files - progress tracked in plan files

## Target Pseudocode

This is the simple, intuitive flow we're aiming for. **Any deviation from this pseudocode should be intentional and justified**:

### main.py
```python
# Phase 1: python agent_tree.py decompose task_file.md
# Phase 2: Human can modify files
# Phase 3: python agent_tree.py solve task_file.md
```

### decompose.py
```python
# Global state for tracking
node_count = 0
seen_tasks = set()

def decompose(task_file):
    global node_count, seen_tasks
    
    if node_count >= 5:
        return  # Hit 5-node limit
    
    task_name = extract_name(task_file)
    children_dir = f"{task_name}_children"
    
    node_count += 1
    # Agent creates: plan file + children tasks in children_dir
    # Each child .md specifies if it's simple or complex
    agent(decompose_prompt(task_file))
    seen_tasks.add(task_file)
    
    for each .md file in children_dir not in seen_tasks:
        seen_tasks.add(file)
        if is_complex(file):  # Claude already marked it as 'complex'
            decompose(file)  # No file moving needed!
```

### solve.py
```python
# Tree search, postorder traversal (leaves first)
solve(task):
    if has_child_or_dependency:
        dependent = get_dependent(task)  # Look for links in ### Dependents
        solve(dependent)
    
    # Generate tree with one-line summaries
    tree_context = generate_tree_with_summaries(workspace_root)
    agent(solve_prompt(task, tree_context))
    # Agent updates plan file with progress and results

# Future: detect_circular_dependencies() - warn user during feedback period
```

    end
```

## Decomposition Flow

1. **Initial Call**: Start with user-provided `task.md` file
2. **Claude Creates**:
   - `task_plan.md` - Analysis and links to children
   - `task_children/` folder with subtask .md files (each marked simple/complex)
3. **For Each Child**: Check if Claude marked it as complex
4. **If Complex**: Recurse on that file (no moving!)
5. **Track Seen**: Avoid reprocessing tasks

## Core Tasks

### 1. Extract and Refactor Decomposition Logic âœ…
- [x] Create new `decompose.py` module

  - Parse `### Dependents` section from task files
  - Extract markdown links to other .md files
  - Return list of dependent file paths
- [x] Implement `generate_tree_with_summaries()`:
  - Build tree structure of all task files
  - Extract one-line summary from each task
  - Mark current task with [YOU ARE HERE]
- [x] Create `solve_prompt` that:
  - Includes tree context
  - Explains agent can read other files if needed
  - Contains coding best practices

## Example Usage

```bash
# Phase 1: Decompose
python agent_tree.py decompose web_scraper.md
# Claude creates: web_scraper_plan.md + web_scraper_children/ folder
# Recursively decomposes complex children

# Phase 2: Human Review (edit markdown files as needed)
# Can modify task descriptions, dependencies, add/remove tasks

# Phase 3: Solve
python agent_tree.py solve web_scraper.md
# Processes dependencies first, then solves bottom-up
# Updates plan files with progress and results
```

## Example Folder Structure

```
tasks/
â”œâ”€â”€ web_scraper.md                    # Root task (complex)
â”œâ”€â”€ web_scraper_plan.md               # Analysis, progress, and results
â””â”€â”€ web_scraper_children/
    â”œâ”€â”€ fetch_urls.md                 # Simple subtask
    â”œâ”€â”€ fetch_urls_plan.md            # Progress and results
    â”œâ”€â”€ parse_html.md                 # Simple subtask
    â”œâ”€â”€ parse_html_plan.md            # Progress and results
    â”œâ”€â”€ extract_data.md               # Complex subtask
    â”œâ”€â”€ extract_data_plan.md          # Analysis, progress, and results
    â””â”€â”€ extract_data_children/
        â”œâ”€â”€ find_selectors.md
        â”œâ”€â”€ find_selectors_plan.md
        â”œâ”€â”€ handle_pagination.md
        â””â”€â”€ handle_pagination_plan.md
```

## Dependency Example

```markdown
# Extract Articles
## Type
complex
## Summary
Extract article data from parsed HTML
### Dependents
- [Parse HTML](../parse_html.md)
- [Find CSS Selectors](./find_selectors.md)
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Areas of Potential Complexity

1. **Dependency Resolution** (Medium Complexity)
   - Parsing markdown for links
   - Building dependency graph
   - Detecting cycles
   - **Mitigation**: Keep it simple - just parse `### Dependents` section, warn on cycles

2. **File Type Detection** (Low Complexity)
   - Distinguishing task vs plan files
   - **Mitigation**: Use naming convention (`_plan.md` suffix)

3. **Tree Context Generation** (Low Complexity)
   - Walking file system
   - Extracting summaries
   - **Mitigation**: Simple recursive walk, first line as summary

4. **State Management** (Low Complexity)
   - Global variables for node count and seen set
   - **Mitigation**: Already simplified with globals

5. **Error Handling** (No Complexity - Development Phase)
   - **Strategy**: Let it crash! No try/except blocks
   - Claude failures â†’ crash with subprocess error
   - Malformed markdown â†’ crash with parsing error
   - File system errors â†’ crash with OS error
   - **Benefit**: Clear stack traces for debugging

### Simplicity Wins

The new design is MUCH simpler than the current system:
- **Clear separation**: decompose.py and solve.py have single responsibilities
- **No complex context objects**: Just a tree string
- **No file moving**: Files stay where created
- **Minimal state**: Just two globals for decomposition
- **Simple file structure**: Predictable naming patterns

## Guiding Principle

**Stay close to the pseudocode**. The pseudocode above represents the core simplicity we're targeting. If implementation details start to stray significantly from this vision, we should:
1. Step back and ask why
2. Consider if the complexity is truly necessary
3. Find ways to hide complexity through clean abstractions
4. Keep the core flow simple and intuitive

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Implementation closely matches the pseudocode
- [ ] Cleaner, more modular codebase
- [ ] Easier human intervention between phases
- [ ] No loss of core functionality
- [ ] Better error messages and recovery
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Clear documentation

## Timeline Estimate

- Task 1: 2-3 hours
- Task 2: 2-3 hours  
- Task 3: 1 hour
- Task 4: 2-3 hours

Total: ~8-10 hours of focused work

## Implementation Notes for Senior Engineer

### Critical Context

1. **Claude CLI Integration**
   - Use subprocess to call `claude` command
   - Pass prompts via stdin or temp files
   - Timeout: Consider 10 minutes for complex decompositions
   - Working directory: Run claude in the task's parent directory

2. **Markdown Parsing**
   - Keep it simple: Use regex or basic string operations
   - Don't overthink - we control the format Claude produces
   - For complexity: Look for `## Type` section with "simple" or "complex"
   - For dependencies: Parse `### Dependents` section for markdown links

3. **File Operations**
   - All paths relative to initial task file location
   - Create folders with `os.makedirs(exist_ok=True)`
   - Use `pathlib` for cleaner path operations

4. **Prompts (Key to Success)**
   - `decompose_prompt`: Must instruct Claude to create specific file structure
   - `solve_prompt`: Must include tree context and explain file reading capability
   - See existing prompts in current codebase for inspiration

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Start with simple integration tests
   - Mock Claude CLI for unit tests
   - Test file structure creation separately from LLM logic

### Quick Start

1. Look at current `src/agent_tree.py` for Claude CLI integration patterns
2. Start with `agent_tree.py` refactor to add subcommands
3. Build `decompose.py` incrementally - test with simple examples
4. `solve.py` can reuse much of the current execution logic

### What to Ignore from Current Codebase

- Complex context objects
- Node progress tracking (X/5 display)
- Tree visualization code
- Workspace timestamp directories (unless you want to keep them)

### Key Insight

The power is in the **pause between phases**. This lets humans fix AI mistakes before execution. Keep this separation clean and the system will be valuable.
